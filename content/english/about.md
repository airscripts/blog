## Hello World!  
Welcome to my blog!  
I’m Francesco, known online as **Airscript**.  

Since I was a kid, I’ve always been curious about the world around me—videogames, sports, cinematography—just to name a few of the countless things that fascinate me.  

Oh, and let’s not forget paleontology—especially **dinosaurs**.  
*Between us, I didn’t really forget them. I just wanted to make sure they got the spotlight they deserve.*  

But out of everything, computer science is what stuck with me the most.  
The idea that I could build tools to improve people's lives through code got me hooked early on. What started as a spark turned into a full-blown **passion**, and eventually, my **career**.  

Today, I work as a **freelance software engineer**, helping bring ideas to life through technology.  

But enough introductions—let me tell you why I decided to start this blog.

## Why a Blog?  
In 2022, I made a decision: I wanted to put myself out there and connect with others in my field.  
The spark? Discovering [Progetto Happiness][progetto-happiness].  

If you haven’t heard of it, it’s an initiative exploring what happiness really is—through questions asked to some truly incredible people.  

So here I am!  
Like Giuseppe from the project, I want to share the beauty I see every day in the people around me.  

This past year has given me so much, and now I’d love to give something back—by writing about it here.

## What Can I Read?  
Since I’m a huge fan of computer science, that’ll be the main theme. But I’ll explore it my way.  

How? With a pinch of **philosophy** and **simplicity**—just like me.  

That said, I want to connect with you, the reader. So from time to time, you’ll also find more personal posts—stories from my daily adventures, lessons learned, and maybe a few random thoughts too.

## Who’s It For?  
This blog is for anyone looking for a fresh perspective.  
For anyone who loves to question things—or just wants to learn something new.  

And hey, even if you’re just curious about why I go by `airscript`, you’re in the right place.
